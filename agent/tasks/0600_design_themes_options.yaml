title: Design v1 — multi-theme + visible polish (clean-room)
goals:
  - Add 6 distinct themes in app/src/theme/themes.ts (tokens: bg, card, text, muted, primary, ring, radius, shadow)
  - Apply tokens to header/nav/buttons/tables/cards across pages (Dashboard/Patients/Billing/Schedule/Clinical)
  - Ensure Style page shows theme cards with “Use” and switching persists to localStorage
  - Add gentle hover/focus states; accessible contrast
deliverables:
  - app/src/theme/themes.ts
  - app/src/modules/ThemeGallery.tsx
  - small edits in app/index.html and app/src/main.tsx (classes .card, .btn)
tests:
  - All existing Playwright tests remain green
constraints:
  - No external UI libraries; minimal, compiling changes only
notes:
  - Prefer a calm healthcare aesthetic; avoid copying vendor text/art
